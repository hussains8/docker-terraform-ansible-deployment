# 🐳 Dockerized Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform & Ansible

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project automates the **containerization**, **infrastructure provisioning**, and **configuration management** of distributed microservices using **Docker**, **Terraform**, and **Ansible**. It aims to standardize service deployment, improve scalability, and ensure repeatable, secure infrastructure delivery across environments.

## **🎯 Goals**
- Simplify multi-service deployments with Docker.
- Automate environment provisioning using Terraform.
- Ensure configuration consistency with Ansible.
- Eliminate manual setup efforts.
- Improve rollout speed and deployment reliability.

---

## **🚀 Key Features**
- ✅ **Service Dockerization**: Containerized multiple microservices with individual Dockerfiles.
- 🧱 **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Provisioned cloud infrastructure on AWS using Terraform.
- 🔧 **Configuration Management**: Used Ansible to configure app servers, databases, and load balancers.
- 🔁 **Repeatable Deployments**: All environments (dev/staging/prod) follow the same reproducible flow.
- 🔐 **Secure & Audited**: Integrated secret management and role-based access provisioning.

---

## **🧰 Tech Stack**
- **Containers**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **IaC**: Terraform (AWS EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, Security Groups)
- **Configuration**: Ansible (Playbooks, Roles, Inventory)
- **Orchestration**: Bash, Makefiles, Shell scripts
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS (tested on EC2, RDS, S3)
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

## Business Outcomes
- Reduced manual provisioning effort by over 70%
- Accelerated service rollouts and environment setup
- Improved deployment consistency and repeatability
- Ensured secure and audited infrastructure practices
